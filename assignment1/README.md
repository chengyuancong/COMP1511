# Assignment 1 - CS Paint  

In this assignment, you will be implementing CS Paint, DPST1091's answer to the venerable drawing program. CS Paint is a program that allows us to draw images to our terminal using a series of commands. The commands are made up of integers (and in later stages, doubles) and are typed directly into our program. Each command will make some change to a digital canvas, a space for drawing.
