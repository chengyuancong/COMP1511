//Without using any typedefs,
//Create a struct to store data for a student
//Each student has a zid, a wam, a name and an address

//Create 2 student variables
//One with data
//  zid: 1231412 
//  wam:  89.5 
//  name: Ronald McDonald 
//  address: 5 Fake Street 

// And another with
// zid: 321323
// wam: 10
// name: Jack Russell
// address: 7 Fake Street

//Write a function that can print a student and use it to print each students details.
 
//Now modify your program to use typedefs.
