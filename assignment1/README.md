# Assignment 1 - CS Paint  

In this assignment, you will be implementing CS Paint, DPST1091's answer to the venerable drawing program. CS Paint is a program that allows us to draw images to our terminal using a series of commands. The commands are made up of integers (and in later stages, doubles) and are typed directly into our program. Each command will make some change to a digital canvas, a space for drawing.

 + ================================================================= +
 + Great style overall. There are a few instance where you could've  +
 + used a few more #defines just to make your code a bit clearer.    +
 + Be sure to watch your line length.                                +
