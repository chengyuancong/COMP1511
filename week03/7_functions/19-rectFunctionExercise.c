// An example of using functions to break
// down a nested loop into less complex parts

//Write a program that reads in a rows and columns from a user and prints out a rectangle of *. It repeats this until it gets non-numeric data.
//Step 1: Write a prototype for a function that prints a rectangle of given dimensions
//Step 2: Write the main function, using this function
//Step 3: Start writing the function, 
//      but to do so, create a prototype for a function that prints out a single row of * of a given size
//Step 4: Write the function that prints out a single row of *
